# Snakes-and-Ladders

Snakes and Ladders Simulator

Here are the rules:
Player starts at square #1 and rolls two dice. They will then move that many spots to the next
space. If the player lands on the bottom of a ladder, then they get to move up the ladder to the
space where the ladder ends. If the player lands on a snakeâ€™s head, then they have to move
down the snake to where the tail ends to their new spot. The player continuously rolls the two
dice until they reach 100.
In the program, the two dice will roll and the total will determine the new space to
occupy. This will continue until they reach square #100.
